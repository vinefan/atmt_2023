Tom &apos;s eyes were full of tears .
what is to @ @ day &apos;s dat @ @ e ?
I &apos;ve missed you so much @ @ , Tom .
should I tell him that I like him or that I love him ?
I have nothing to fear .
I just in @ @ vented a new word @ @ - @ @ pro @ @ cess @ @ or en @ @ ab @ @ ling to pronounce them back @ @ war @ @ ds .

do you want me to tell Tom that we won &apos;t do that ?
two weeks have passed and I haven &apos;t seen you .
don &apos;t loo @ @ k @ @ !
why don &apos;t you love me ?
Tom wants to buy a bas @ @ s guit @ @ ar @ @ , but he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
I know you see it , but are you really looking at it ?
I cannot put up with her beha @ @ vi @ @ or .
any of you can do it .
I remember what I saw .
they admitted that the @ @ y @ @ &apos; d li @ @ ed .
I don &apos;t like swimming in poo @ @ l @ @ s .
can you understand the meaning of this sent @ @ ence ?
the man was hiding in a den @ @ se forest .
I know that this is weir @ @ d .
that would make sense .
no one had seen anything .
I have no si @ @ bl @ @ ings .
what &apos;s the gold @ @ en ru @ @ le ?
he can hardly speak any English .
I had my watch men @ @ ded .
we can help you .
are you involved in polit @ @ ic @ @ s ?
b @ @ low out the cand @ @ les .
I wasn &apos;t entirely sure myself .
you don &apos;t have to lie .
it was a beautiful night .
I think you made the right choice .
the truth is I told a lie .
Tom has the experience necessary .
how do you stop this ?
you have too many ir @ @ ons in the fire .
but it &apos;s me who should thank you .
he came while I was still asleep .
I took over the business from Fa @ @ ther .
o @ @ il is expensive .
where did Tom buy it ?
I bought a house .
do you know who we are ?
it &apos;s as old as the world .
Dan announ @ @ ced that he and Linda were getting divor @ @ ced .
I have a vis @ @ a .
it will be a great pleasure for me to translate the story and to read it to you .
what &apos;s with the lu @ @ g @ @ ga @ @ ge ?
something is asked of me .
it &apos;s like being a k @ @ id in a candy store .
ma @ @ ths is a good subject .
you really speak French well .
for exam @ @ ple @ @ , more people are choo @ @ sing to live together and have children without getting married .
are you seriously thinking about going ?
it was a pleasure meeting you , Tom .
if you don &apos;t eat @ @ , you &apos;ll die .
I don &apos;t know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
I don &apos;t have the right e @ @ qui @ @ p @ @ ment .
I ran outside and the door locked itself behind me .
it would be coun @ @ ter @ @ - @ @ produ @ @ ctive to do such a thing .
what do you want ?
I &apos;m waiting im @ @ pati @ @ ent @ @ ly .
s @ @ pin @ @ o @ @ z @ @ a was a pan @ @ the @ @ ist .
I like both sci @ @ ence and ma @ @ th .
we &apos;re not certain of that yet .
I know it &apos;s not impossible .
I work in the morning .
Tom has request @ @ ed my as @ @ sistance .
do you want to get us both kil @ @ led ?
they all speak French .
why are you so good at explain @ @ ing thing @ @ s ?
no one will stop me .
I &apos;m a tra @ @ ine @ @ e .
how much are you being paid to do this ?
she was loved by everybody in the village .
where do you train your studen @ @ ts ?
have you seen my camer @ @ a ?
I hear you were gr @ @ oun @ @ ded .
this book is too large to go in my pocket .
could you please over @ @ look it this time ?
when I was your age , I had a boy @ @ friend .
I hate that guy .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
he borrowed the car from his friend .
this TV was made in China .
I feel sick every morning .
you should know yourself .
he took this photo .
would you like to read this magaz @ @ ine ?
he took charge of the firm after his father &apos;s death .
Tom and I usually talked to each other in French .
I filled up the vase with water .
it doesn &apos;t matter who says that , it &apos;s not true .
this is how I made it .
do you know how to play che @ @ s @ @ s ?
this bicycle is mine . you @ @ r @ @ s is over there .
it &apos;s an emerg @ @ enc @ @ y !
for me , the real world is just a fic @ @ tion .
speaking of fil @ @ m @ @ s , why not go to the cinema tonight ?
Tom felt his phone vi @ @ br @ @ ate .
will it be fine tomorrow ?
I never really gave it much thought .
Tom likes living in Boston .
any @ @ thing you wan @ @ t , my de @ @ ar .
she attracted me at first sight .
that is the fun @ @ ni @ @ est jo @ @ ke that I have ever hear @ @ d .
he promised to provi @ @ de inform @ @ ation .
I &apos;m taking care of it . you can rela @ @ x . you can rely on me .
are you still sic @ @ k ?
I &apos;ve just spoken to your French teacher and he says you &apos;re doing well in his class .
every @ @ body &apos;s in a hur @ @ ry these days .
she likes to go to the library .
everyone is waiting in the other room .
it matters to me .
the cold air re @ @ vi @ @ ved Tom .
are you out of your mind ?
she temp @ @ ted him .
everyone can make a difference in their own lives and ther @ @ e @ @ by colle @ @ cti @ @ vely make the world a better place for themselves and others around them .
you &apos;re not in a hurry , are you ?
let &apos;s come back to it later .
I should talk to Tom .
you &apos;d better stay with me .
once upon a time there lived an em @ @ per @ @ or who was a great con @ @ qu @ @ er @ @ or @ @ , and re @ @ ig @ @ ned over more countries than anyone in the world .
can you come to the party ?
don &apos;t sp @ @ las @ @ h me !
Tom hardly spoke any French when I first met him .
I don &apos;t have enough money for my trip .
there &apos;s only one pretty child in the world , and every mother has it .
j @ @ ac @ @ qu @ @ es made it clear that he wanted to meet Mr G @ @ ag @ @ n @ @ on .
everyone is free to contribu @ @ te .
Tom was mu @ @ gged on his way home from work .
they made sure nobody could see them .
a guy nearly ran into us .
I think we have some un @ @ finished business .
I &apos;ve lost my f @ @ ill @ @ ing .
do you think that &apos;s tru @ @ e ?
if you would be a good read @ @ er , read @ @ ; if a writ @ @ er , write .
I hate those spi @ @ der @ @ s . they &apos;re always there to frea @ @ k me out when I &apos;m clean @ @ ing .
no such person exist @ @ s .
do your be @ @ st !
I gave up hope .
she advised him to cut down on smoking .
no matter how much I think about it , I can &apos;t understand it .
she told him a joke .
can you put the children to be @ @ d ?
Mari @ @ e &apos;s hiding something from me .
did you go to Tom &apos;s party last Satur @ @ day ?
he wrote a novel based on anci @ @ ent my @ @ ths .
Tom went rock cli @ @ mb @ @ ing .
she didn &apos;t like this game .
they &apos;ve known each other for a very long time .
don &apos;t touch th @ @ is !
you &apos;ve been warned .
he plays the piano very well .
what makes you so sure Tom was the one who sto @ @ le your bicycle @ @ ?
she has good idea @ @ s .
what a hor @ @ rib @ @ le thing @ @ !
we have no choice but to give up the whole plan .
you &apos;re a tra @ @ it @ @ or .
we take ris @ @ ks all the time .
z @ @ ail @ @ ai @ @ b @ @ a B @ @ ar is hi @ @ ring wa @ @ it @ @ er @ @ s ; are you interested ?
I can &apos;t li @ @ f @ @ t my right ar @ @ m .
I tried flying from the top of the tree .
this pri @ @ est is a good man .
I sometimes lie on the grass .
Tom thought Mary was safe .
I just want to know why you brought me here .
open the door .
it &apos;s almost hard to believe all these beautiful things were made by hand such a long time ago .
we assume that he is honest .
are you all right ?
w @ @ hi @ @ che @ @ ver road you may ta @ @ ke , it will lead to the station .
if I were you , I &apos;d buy that one .
he makes himself ac @ @ ces @ @ sib @ @ le to all who see @ @ k his coun @ @ se @ @ l .
I &apos;m sorry I mis @ @ understood you .
