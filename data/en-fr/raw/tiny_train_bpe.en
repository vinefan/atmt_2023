Today is a new day!
I want you to get started right away.
Do you see the six windows on the fac@@ ad@@ e?
One should be respe@@ ct@@ ful of other@@ 's belie@@ f@@ s rather than mo@@ ck them.
People usually die if you kill them.
It was working.
Tom needs us to show him the way.
Just do your job.
The train was about to leave the station.
Here is an at@@ om@@ ic power plan@@ t.
When the al@@ ar@@ m clock goes off@@ , I don@@ â€™@@ t mo@@ ve.
This feels like sil@@ k.
A traffic accident happened there.
Tom didn't do that very much.
Tom had just one word to cut so that out of this sent@@ ence, fore@@ ver, disa@@ p@@ pea@@ red our Mary.
We im@@ por@@ t coffee from Brazil.
But you cannot understand. How could you understand what it is to feel ol@@ d?
Why do I believe you?
You spread your af@@ fa@@ irs too thin.
Those box speak@@ ers have a good re@@ ver@@ b.
They were hanging on her words.
Instead of complain@@ ing, may@@ be you should help.
I think we can handle that.
I am deeply interested in art.
You are old enough to know this.
I accepted his inv@@ it@@ ation.
I'd like to hear you sing your new song.
The children are going to the be@@ ach today.
Can you believe this is really happen@@ ing?
He paid the lo@@ an with interest@@ .
I know you like chocolate.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
The de@@ er was running by it@@ self.
For him, divor@@ ce is a good inven@@ ti@@ on, with one so@@ le dis@@ adv@@ anta@@ ge@@ : you have to get married first.
The bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an com@@ mis@@ sion@@ 's recomm@@ end@@ ations were igno@@ red.
I wasn't told where we were going.
That's doub@@ t@@ ful.
She intended to become an ac@@ t@@ res@@ s.
He is always expres@@ sion@@ less.
He has travel@@ ed around the world in eighty days by himself.
B@@ la@@ me it on the weather.
I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you!
Shame on you for your disc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment@@ !
He left the room without saying a word.
I'd like to get medi@@ cal insur@@ ance.
He went down the h@@ ill.
The girls gi@@ gg@@ led.
Is anybody there?
I'm not scared of wom@@ en.
The angry mo@@ b over@@ turned cars and smashed sto@@ re@@ front windows.
I resi@@ g@@ n.
I know he is busy.
The man and his hor@@ se that fell off the cli@@ f@@ f were soon rescu@@ ed.
She is very c@@ un@@ ning.
It was a com@@ promise.
He is ap@@ t to for@@ get.
A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
Turn right at the next inter@@ se@@ ction.
You look busy.
They all laughed at their err@@ or.
Tom didn't eat the apple you gave him.
Birds have ne@@ st@@ s, spi@@ ders have web@@ s, and human@@ s have friendship.
T@@ en years have gone by.
I'm trappe@@ d.
Mari@@ e re@@ lu@@ ct@@ an@@ tly takes another piece of cake.
I left behind some important docu@@ ments for the company at home. Sor@@ ry, but could you please go and get them for me now?
"@@ L@@ ist@@ en to me@@ ," said the D@@ emon@@ , plac@@ ing his hand upon my head.
You should have stopped.
He sp@@ rained his ank@@ le.
Tom looks older than he really is.
I was watching the scene hol@@ ding my breath.
Mary got to know her boyfriend in Paris.
Hand in your paper@@ s.
Are you still married?
You must pay in adv@@ ance.
In K@@ ab@@ y@@ li@@ a, we speak the K@@ ab@@ yle language.
She turned a p@@ age of her book.
Yes, you should wear red li@@ p@@ stic@@ k for V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ e's day.
Tom isn't invited to parti@@ es often.
You see the words that I ty@@ ped on the scre@@ en, but you don't see the te@@ ars that I shed over the ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard.
Give me a ti@@ p.
What do you want to drink with your me@@ al?
She lives near the beach.
I want to live in a cast@@ le.
Don't you see the pat@@ ter@@ n?
I don't date.
Be respe@@ ct@@ ful.
He can swim fast.
He saw a pretty girl.
The windows were open.
Tom wanted to go home early.
I forgot my de@@ bit car@@ d at home.
You're tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y.
Mary threw a po@@ ta@@ to through the window.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
I find that it's best to find a happy bal@@ ance between origin@@ ality and stic@@ king to a stri@@ ct standar@@ d.
I remember meeting her somewhere.
I'm br@@ inging home a pizz@@ a.
Here is where it all happens.
S@@ oon your efforts will be rewar@@ ded.
Is the coffee ho@@ t?
Thanks for jo@@ ining us.
It's a p@@ ity that you can't travel with us.
I wonder what happened to P@@ au@@ l.
You know where to find me if you need anything.
No one knows his name.
I'm on to you.
It's blowing very hard.
I didn't know you were still here.
We talked about everything we could think about.
I don't have much time.
Don't you feel stupid now?
Tom's phone can take pictures.
What do you want the message to be@@ ?
M@@ om said I caught a cold because I went out with we@@ t hair.
How many more for@@ ks do you need?
R@@ are@@ ly have I met such a gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful d@@ anc@@ er.
I've missed another chance.
I don't know how to cont@@ act you.
Do you want to join me for lun@@ ch@@ ?
All of these lett@@ ers are addressed to you.
Tom knew where he had put his keys.
You could count to ten when you were two.
I just found it.
Tom is laughing.
Do you know what day it is today?
The poor cat was run over by a truck.
I don't want to get involved in that business.
There isn't any problem at all.
I was over@@ w@@ hel@@ med.
The boy was clever enough to solve the puzz@@ le.
I live with a por@@ cu@@ p@@ ine.
I appreciate your work.
The system is ri@@ g@@ ge@@ d.
An arti@@ st must have an eye for col@@ our.
Oh w@@ ow@@ ! What's th@@ is, you're having lunch without me!
You sound tired.
Maybe Tom is in love.
Look at the me@@ ter.
Thomas changed into proper clo@@ thing.
My mother bought two bottles of orange ju@@ ice.
Ta@@ king everything into consi@@ der@@ ation@@ , the result is better than I expe@@ cted.
I guess right n@@ ine times out of ten.
That's a nice pair of legs.
It is by this reason that he left school.
"@@ Have you fin@@ is@@ hed@@ ?" "@@ On the contr@@ ary. I haven't even star@@ te@@ d@@ ."
He doesn't like beef. N@@ either do I@@ .
Where did you go to school?
Please don't di@@ stract me from my work.
By teach@@ ing, we learn.
I tell you a little secret.
I'm not scared at all.
He was ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed by his girlfriend.
His office is near the train station.
Tom was sitting under a tre@@ e, drinking wine.
I've been hoping to meet you.
Don't work too har@@ d!
Can you wash my je@@ an@@ s?
Do you speak M@@ al@@ te@@ se?
I'm as curi@@ ous as you are.
Oh, how we la@@ ug@@ he@@ d!
What's your occu@@ p@@ ation?
That picture does not do justice to him.
Don't cut in while we're talking.
It's because I was asked to come that I'm here.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
He is wise who ne@@ i@@ ther hop@@ es nor fe@@ ars anything from the un@@ certain future.
Our class has twenty-@@ five boys and tw@@ enty girls.
Go away before they see you here.
I'm with them now.
Once I re@@ ti@@ re, I will de@@ dic@@ ate my whole time to Tatoeba.
It's mer@@ ely a joke.
I do not have a sister.
S@@ am is two years younger than Tom.
May I borrow your bi@@ ke?
What does your father like?
What a cat@@ a@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he@@ !
For the shar@@ ks, we saw them, not by un@@ it@@ s, nor by ten@@ s, nor by hun@@ dre@@ d@@ s; but by thous@@ and@@ s and by my@@ ri@@ ad@@ s. T@@ r@@ ust me, there are more shar@@ ks in the sea than mor@@ tal@@ s on land.
You should get up early.
Lo@@ ve is ter@@ ri@@ fied of everything that is not it@@ self.
He'll be back in ten.
If I wanted to sc@@ are you, I would have told you about what I drea@@ m@@ t about a few weeks ago.
You're not dead yet.
I know a good restaurant that's in@@ expensive.
Who is the person in char@@ ge?
T@@ rying to find happin@@ ess only makes you un@@ happy.
I want to speak to a lawyer.
He aven@@ ged his dead father.
She liked that.
I'm sor@@ e all over.
Why don't you sit down@@ ?
Stop show@@ ing off@@ !
The weather is very cold in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l.
I'm doing you a fav@@ or.
You were afra@@ id, weren't you?
I don't like the tast@@ e of on@@ ions.
They never returned to their country.
When do you mean to start?
Why do the stars tw@@ ink@@ le?
When I came hom@@ e, he was watching TV.
She nam@@ ed him Char@@ les.
She s@@ ang better than him.
I made a proposal.
What do you plan on doing tonight?
I'm afraid you can't do that.
There is milk in the re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ ator.
I don't know her address.
I don't blame you for doing that.
I have a friend who lives in Kyoto.
I think you're too pick@@ y.
I opened the window to let in some fresh a@@ ir.
I could not stop laughing.
Pre@@ ss any key to cont@@ in@@ ue.
I'm not rac@@ ist.
The fi@@ re, dri@@ ven by an e@@ a@@ st win@@ d, destro@@ yed the center of the city.
You look ter@@ rif@@ ic.
Sor@@ ry to have kept you waiting so long.
Of cour@@ se I'll go.
This mountain is difficult to cli@@ mb.
We needed this.
Can you think of a better way?
You've run out of things to drink.
Call me if you want to do something together tomorrow.
At what time are we going to get a b@@ ite to eat@@ , with all that?
Who's your most interesting friend@@ ?
Be n@@ ic@@ er to your brother.
Get the he@@ ll out of here!
I wasn't told that.
She broke the cu@@ p, too.
One day he was walking along the stree@@ t.
We'll see each other again some@@ day.
They hid in the c@@ ell@@ ar.
I'm a d@@ anc@@ er.
My father was a teacher.
I'm starting to feel des@@ perate.
The concert was a success.
Let's continu@@ e where we left off yesterday.
I believe that this is not a good idea.
You were ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed, weren't you?
F@@ in@@ ally he invited all and sun@@ dry to par@@ take of the cake and all.
Is this lake de@@ ep@@ ?
Se@@ a tur@@ t@@ les don't have teeth.
How are you taking it?
We live together.
Did it snow yesterday?
Are you from around here?
Where do you live?
No gif@@ t is more precious than tru@@ st.
You don't have to answer.
T@@ r@@ ang asked if she could share my bed.
My watch ran down and I didn't know the time.
They gre@@ e@@ ted me.
I would like to kiss you.
Have fun.
Are you in love with Layla@@ ?
He had a gent@@ len@@ ess that was attr@@ active to wom@@ en.
Char@@ ge@@ !
He likes tea.
Whose friend is he?
This morning I missed the 8@@ :@@ 30 train by five minute@@ s.
This li@@ d is too ti@@ ght for me to open.
I have to go back to work.
Mi@@ ke and Ken are friends.
You don't sound too sure.
A@@ in@@ 't that cu@@ te@@ ?
They collected shel@@ ls on the beach.
What exactly did you say?
He set off to Paris.
The mes@@ sen@@ ger left for London in secret.
There's no way I'm going to work on Sunday.
It's hard for an old man to change his way of li@@ ving.
A@@ ir is a mi@@ x@@ ture of var@@ ious ga@@ ses.
Mis@@ understand@@ ings do occur@@ .
Are you going to be OK?
What's going on with you? You haven't been talking to me for a while now.
You don't know anything about I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l.
She only worked for the sa@@ ke of money.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
K@@ it@@ ty the cat gets in the car to go for a ride.
Does this story hold water?
M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el Jack@@ son died.
Would you like to come to my party?
The hotel is on fire.
We expected him to support us.
Her behavior isn't normal for a young girl.
You didn't see nothing.
This room is too big.
These problems will be solved in the near future.
Sami's plane crashed in the fi@@ el@@ d.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I'm all set.
My computer won't start any more.
I've been in Boston for less than a month.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't speak French.
Did you find the difference between these two photo@@ s?
It seems that the rain@@ y seas@@ on has set in.
I told you that was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous.
What was the color of the apple he gave you?
They survi@@ v@@ ed, even though the building was destro@@ yed.
Who wants to go sho@@ pp@@ ing?
He must have been crazy to say such a thing.
My heart was p@@ oun@@ ding as my turn got near@@ er.
That's not fa@@ ir@@ ! You saw my cards in the m@@ ir@@ r@@ or@@ !
She was so beautiful that the mer@@ chan@@ t's son could not help k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing down to kiss her hand.
I am laughing so that you will be happy.
If I knew you better, perhaps I would have let you in.
I want to go there once again.
I'm beginning to get used to doing this.
He wrote a book about his con@@ ver@@ sion to I@@ sla@@ m.
I found it in the at@@ tic.
I don't know how to cont@@ act you.
I invited her to a movie.
Tom says it as it is.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
How is the weather there?
A ma@@ the@@ mat@@ ical truth is ne@@ i@@ ther simple nor compli@@ cat@@ ed@@ ; it is.
He is studying history at the university.
He is such a show off.
Can I think about it?
This is the fin@@ al strugg@@ le.
They're very smart.
You accused him of having stolen the bike.
Why don't we talk for a while?
I helped my parents with the hou@@ se@@ work.
He knows Mr. Da@@ vi@@ d@@ son well.
Get back to where you started.
That is of no use to me.
Get me all the information you can on this matter.
I went to Boston by train.
Maybe Tom should pay more attention in class.
You were sleep@@ ing, weren't you?
There are no d@@ ru@@ gs here.
That's what coun@@ ts.
They've crossed the border.
Give me the mic@@ ro@@ phone.
I never thought I'd see your face again.
We were playing ru@@ g@@ by.
I was born in 198@@ 2 in A@@ th@@ en@@ s, where I still live today.
I feel much sa@@ f@@ er now.
Tom notic@@ ed Mary's hands sha@@ king.
Tomorro@@ w, I'll take the books to the library.
You must've been wrong.
Tom always sings in the shower.
Canadi@@ ans are our friends.
Leave that box where it is.
He's got a headache.
Were you born there?
Do you see a boat on the hor@@ i@@ z@@ on?
Let's decide together where to go first.
Please f@@ ill out this question@@ nai@@ re and send it to us.
I want to be alone for a while.
This skirt is che@@ a@@ p.
I'm playing with my friends.
I think you're right.
Don't che@@ at.
May I take your order@@ ?
I don't understand and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain it once more.
Tom drank straight from the bottle.
S@@ tar@@ t at on@@ ce, or you will be late.
I ordered you a drink.
They have gone far away.
He probably didn't have sex with her.
Please call him up.
Hey, your dog just bit me.
I especially like your chocolate cake.
Tom is the tallest guy I've ever seen.
You should not go alone.
That's your du@@ ty.
The doctor advised that she take a holiday.
I've been so@@ b@@ er for three years.
He will have no chance of win@@ ning her heart.
It's as old as the h@@ ills.
H@@ old this.
The hor@@ se is mine.
He could swim across the river when he was in his te@@ en@@ s.
How many kids do you have?
Look at these pri@@ c@@ es.
You're the lead@@ er.
I have little interest in history.
He studies ten hours a day on average.
I love you more and more each day.
It was surprising that she said that.
She doesn't drink.
I'd like to tell you something in private.
Do not inter@@ fer@@ e!
He took her in his arms.
You are l@@ ying.
Are you certain that's what you want?
I don't think I can do this anymore.
They missed the de@@ ad@@ line.
He threw the letter into the fire.
The propo@@ sa@@ l is accep@@ ted.
Get your mother.
You eat good meals in this bo@@ ard@@ ing@@ house.
What do you have in your hand@@ ?
I've known about this for years.
Tom jumped back just in time.
She bought a couple of boo@@ ts.
I teach here.
Were you really angr@@ y?
She denied having met him.
Stop crit@@ ici@@ zing me!
I would like to go, but I don't have a car.
He foo@@ led her.
Be nice.
I'm waiting for my friend.
I often sit up late at night to read.
I guess I'll have to think it over.
What's that picture inside your lo@@ ck@@ er?
Who's in command here?
Le@@ tt@@ ers are deli@@ ver@@ ed every day.
Have you learned nothing from your mistak@@ es?
You'll understand it right away.
After ten years as business part@@ ner@@ s, they decided to part wa@@ ys.
Read as much as possible.
I have y@@ aw@@ ned.
I can't pin@@ point the problem.
He put his hand to his fore@@ head.
I don't want to get you into trouble.

The he@@ li@@ co@@ pter is so useful that some@@ day it may take the place of cars and tra@@ ins.
Tom sent Mary a lot of letters.
Are you enjo@@ ying your@@ self?
She had fun with him.
Tom lac@@ ks confi@@ den@@ ce in himself.
All men are equal under the law.
It's rather ir@@ on@@ ic.
I certainly have had great lu@@ ck.
He w@@ oke up in the middle of the night.
You sent the pac@@ k@@ age by plan@@ e.
The meat is tou@@ gh@@ .
Are you for@@ ge@@ t@@ ful@@ ?
I had a bad stom@@ ach@@ -@@ ache.
I'll give him your message when he comes.
Tom had no ally, but he himself was making different ene@@ mi@@ es.
Their married life was full bli@@ ss.
I had a lot of help.
Maybe Tom has had an accident.
I'm aching to go to Australia.
Your p@@ it@@ ching is far su@@ peri@@ or to mine.
I am trying to con@@ qu@@ er his heart.
I think the train will come soon.
You did what you had to do.
H@@ on@@ est@@ ly@@ ...
Do you know someone who knows about air condition@@ ing?
You always were a good cook.
Mary is washing her hair.
I live in B@@ i@@ a@@ Å‚@@ y@@ sto@@ k.
No one will survi@@ ve.
This progra@@ m is brought to you by the spon@@ sor@@ s now appear@@ ing on your scre@@ en.
What do they sel@@ l@@ ?
Do you prefer blon@@ des or bru@@ ne@@ tte@@ s?
You have no life.
She wrote him a long lett@@ er, but she didn't mail it.
She bl@@ ushed de@@ e@@ pl@@ y.
I do not understand you.
I won't accept that.
We haven't seen you for a long time.
I have to do it by myself.
Look out for pick@@ poc@@ ke@@ ts.
I have to translate the sentences.
They came back last We@@ d@@ nes@@ day.
They didn't tell us anything.
I hate women who say that all men are the sa@@ me.
I don't know why you're all so angry.

How do you like your new school?

Tom answered the teacher@@ 's questions.
You're right, no doub@@ t about it.
You're very s@@ op@@ hi@@ stic@@ ated.
I'm o@@ ppo@@ sed to any type of war.
He did the work on his own.
Take a look at this ma@@ p.

Se@@ ver@@ al people lay woun@@ ded.
My father dri@@ ves a very old car.
The book is for me@@ ; the flowers are for us.
Please don't forget to put sta@@ mp@@ s on the lett@@ ers I gave you to po@@ st.
Two women are singing.
We've been told not to do that.
It turns out that you knew everything but kept quiet.

I forgot to do something.
Tom and Mary are both very hungry.
You're going in the wrong dire@@ ction.
Tom was fired.

Watch me do it!
I want this letter opened now.
Go warm up.
I'm assu@@ ming this is your father.

Let's see who can finish doing this first.
I think you might be over@@ re@@ ac@@ ting.
Where do you want to eat?
If I knew how to use a compu@@ ter, may@@ be they would pay me more.
Be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful bir@@ d!
You can't do both at the same time.
I had to make a choice.

I was asked to wait here.
I want to write an article.
Tom is a play@@ er.
Why so g@@ lu@@ m?
A cold kept him in bed.
What would you like me to do?
Tom said that Mary looked exhausted.
She may have missed the train.
I didn't say I wasn't free.
I@@ ll@@ ness can often occur at a very in@@ con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent time.
Are you with the F@@ B@@ I@@ ?
I worry about your health.

You're very open.
She tried to persuade him to buy her a pe@@ ar@@ l ne@@ ck@@ lac@@ e.
I actually am 8@@ 1 years old but if I sub@@ tr@@ act the time I've waited to get my bags at the airpor@@ t, I'm only 4@@ 3.
They're ignor@@ ing me.
I want you to stay here with her.
Sami is really un@@ lucky when it comes to wom@@ en.
Please give my regar@@ ds to your father.
No mechan@@ ical problems were f@@ ound.
This is not good at all.
Your gar@@ den needs some att@@ ention.
He felt in his poc@@ ket for his ligh@@ ter.
What're you doing today?
You're part of the problem.
I was hoping that you'd know the answer.
Sami is a compu@@ l@@ si@@ ve liar.
He wants to kill me.
The baby is sleeping.
What do you like about her?
I'm not here to buy shoes.
You'll have to do that on your own.
Did anybody see you?
How does he think it w@@ ent?
Let's be careful.
The students were ill at eas@@ e before the exam.
Push the door open.
Who listen@@ s to Tom?
Do you know anyone who@@ 's not on F@@ ac@@ e@@ book?
How much does an egg cost?
That's why I'm here.
Nobody answered the door.
It's hard to get a taxi outside the station.
She made mistake after mistake.
These mo@@ tor@@ c@@ ycle@@ s are the same ty@@ pe.
According to the paper@@ , there was a big fire in Boston.
Everyone looked relie@@ ved.
S@@ tre@@ t@@ ch your ar@@ ms stra@@ ight.
