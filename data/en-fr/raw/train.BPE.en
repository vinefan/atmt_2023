He had long hair last year.
Your question has no answer.
How aw@@ ful!
I hate it when my parents fight.
He who does not work does not have the right to eat.
Don't be a stranger.
I know Tom is all right now.
Tom said he would try.
We need to correct those mistak@@ en assump@@ tions.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
Sami was five minutes away.
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow.

Long live the g@@ eri@@ ocrac@@ y!
She cannot play the piano.
Men only think about one thing.

Never talk to strangers.
How could you do that?
I had to go back.
I have a pre@@ d@@ il@@ ection for beef.
You have everything.

I want to see it.
They must be crazy to believe such nonsense.
I want you to be quiet.
C@@ ot@@ ton absor@@ bs water.
Get back to where you started.
I had to work on Sunday.
You guys suc@@ k.
Who's going to cook for us?
What language were they speak@@ ing?
Never tell lies.
Both alternatives are possible.
Maybe I should also add sentences without transl@@ ations? It is a very fast way of impro@@ ving the popular@@ ity of one's own language.
Do you want to bet on that?
We made sacrifices.
I had only one drink.
I've chosen her to be my wife.
I can't kiss you the way you want to be kis@@ sed.
Stop tw@@ ist@@ ing my arm@@ !
If he sends me any letters, I just tear them up and throw them away.
I was warned.
Sooner or later, Tom will likely agree to help us.
This is longer than any other bridge in the world.
What's the teacher expl@@ ain@@ ing?
We'd like separate chec@@ ks.
Who wouldn't want to live here?
We're crossing the border.
Who is nex@@ t?
Are you sure you're warm enough?
I don't know who my ancestors are. Our pap@@ ers got lost during the Fl@@ ood.
Sit down and shut up.
It'll rain for sure.
It's not on the menu.
Tom is the only one who doesn't know.
I went to the super@@ market.
Droplets are falling on my laptop computer.
I am sure.
I believe him to be intelligent.
I study English at home.
I'm still a memb@@ er.
This kind of work makes me hungry.
Smoking is bad for your health.
Indeed, dwar@@ f tos@@ sing is an Olympic sport@@ !
Yes, I'm afraid so.
You should keep your promises.
I just want to be perfect.
I'm glad I invited you.
There is only one truth.
Man has a great capac@@ ity to adapt to environ@@ mental changes.
I wonder what has become of him after he went to America.
I don't have much interest in cooking.
Tom asked me to be here.
You look gor@@ ge@@ ous in that dress.
He isn't dumber than you.
I still can't believe I'm going to be on your team.
Come and keep me company.

Mary accepted everything without complaining.
He's an exorcis@@ t.
It's your turn to sing.
They were scolded by the teacher.
Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
I'll never do this again.
I surviv@@ ed.
This glass isn't mine.
It's hard to choose.
My dog has cancer.
Do you remember the day this picture was taken?
What did she do to you?
Cre@@ ating Tatoeba was a good idea.
Are you happy here?
She cheat@@ ed on the test.
Can I speak to you a moment?
They stood on the hill@@ top.
I've never felt like this before.
What's your favorite skin care product?
You can borrow three books at a time.
I'm in absolutely total agre@@ ement.
This car is h@@ is.
I'm sure Tom and Mary will be tired when they get home.
I wouldn't go with you for anything.
He made up the whole story.
You're finished already.
I don't know what's going to happen to you.
Everybody needs to know this.
F@@ all is late this year.
They're on good terms with their neighbors.
I'm using a new computer.
Mary always studies for two hours a day.
What did she do with it?
It's a ru@@ le.
Who are you closest to in your family?
You're worse than Tom.
Do the Germans have any other concer@@ ns in life apar@@ t from consu@@ mer@@ is@@ m?
You should not respect a man because he is rich.
The chair cre@@ aked as he sat down.
He express@@ ed his belief in her hon@@ est@@ y.
Only they themselves understand what they say.
No, he hasn't said anything about it.
Everyone is going to call me a liar.
The child was cr@@ ying for her mother.
They ruined it.
They want peace.
Are we being charged with something?
I really hate dai@@ ry produc@@ ts.
I was right on the spot when it happened.
Be punctual.
I am four@@ te@@ en years old.
You look so pale.
I really don't think that's a good idea.
That's it. I've done all I can do.
The a@@ ard@@ var@@ k is a medi@@ um@@ -@@ si@@ zed animal.
The school rules requi@@ re students to wear school uniform@@ s.
Where can I buy book@@ s?
I have two eyes.
I've removed the comm@@ a.
Do you have an extra key?
His bad le@@ g prevented him from win@@ ning the race.
You're being paran@@ oi@@ d.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
I have to say that I'm sorry.
I admire her efforts.
We can't get close to the enemy.
There are a lot of stars larger than our own S@@ un.
They aren't dumber than you.
Can't this wait until things are back to normal@@ ?
Tom doesn't go to school yet.
My mother is a very good cook.
Are you watching the presidential de@@ bat@@ e?
You were right.
Now I am free.
Who spread these rum@@ ours?
That was written by Taro Akagawa.
She made it clear that she couldn't make it in time for the meeting.
I know you considered me a close friend.
Things will only get worse.
The girl is drinking tea.
I'm surprised to see you.
This is your faul@@ t.
She met him on the beach.
They arrived at the hotel.
Is your name Layla@@ ?
I can't do this job alone.
I had gotten no sleep the night befor@@ e, so I kept dro@@ p@@ ping off during the meeting.
Hav@@ en't you eaten yet?
Don't talk to me about religion.
Who is there?
He is stronger than me.
I sw@@ ore I'd never do that.
The dog came running to me.
Tom is thro@@ wing st@@ ones at bir@@ ds.
Yesterday was a good day.
Tom is a bad co@@ ach.
She died last night.
I'm waiting for the bus.
This rug was made without the use of child labor.
D@@ eat@@ h before dis@@ honor@@ !
I o@@ iled my bicycle.
Turn around.
This is not necessary.
We want reven@@ ge.
Put on your shoes. Let's go out for dinner.
You're faithful.
The train should be here on time.
I'd be un@@ happy if that happened again.
This show is stupid.
Write Spanish.
Don't even think of asking me what I think about you right now.
I don't care if it sno@@ ws.
There's someone I want you to meet.
I'm not writing about you.
Your question is not re@@ lev@@ ant to the subject.
She came to see me.
This chair is too small.
How much time do you actually spend thinking about the futu@@ re?
I don't know who you want to meet.
If the doors of perception were cle@@ ans@@ ed everything would appear to man as it is, infin@@ ite.
Be@@ er is my fuel.

Many great think@@ ers who were unknown while ali@@ ve became famous after death.
You're a terrible person.
It is difficult to get him to do anything on the spu@@ r of the moment.
In Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an, '@@ d@@ ' and '@@ t@@ ' at the end of a word are generally silent.
How many times do I have to tell you not to eat candy just before dinner?
No one can do that.
I have some inside information about the company's plans to go public.
Do you know the man staring at you?
No sooner had he seen it than he turned pale.
Everyone knows we're rich.
I appreciate the sentiment.
I'm rich.
Fin@@ ish drinking your milk.
The old man died from hun@@ ger.
2016 is coming to an end and a new year is about to begin@@ !
You're the oldest.
I slept for eight hours last night.
Are you here alone?
Anyone could do that.
He is good for nothing.
Do you like music@@ ?
Take mine.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
This is not what I order@@ ed.
This is such a waste of time.
Tom is always playing video games.
I have been to the store before.
Stop s@@ ending me flowers.
Please un@@ dress from the waist up.
That's a stupid questi@@ on!
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight?
Are you ready for the trip?
You need to be more careful from now on.
Can you look at me?
Did you regis@@ ter your product?
Dan had to decide whom to believ@@ e.
You must give up smok@@ ing, as it is un@@ healthy.
There is a television in my room.
They're looking for you.
I'm trying to clean the house.
I haven't used Anki in a week and now I have 5@@ 00 flash@@ cards du@@ e.
The questions came fast and fu@@ ri@@ ous from the large number of re@@ por@@ ters who had gathered outside the cour@@ thou@@ se.
I remember those days.
Are you really as old as you say you are?
Sami didn't really like that girl.
I can't get the c@@ ap off this bottle.
I recognized her at first gl@@ ance.
I want to talk to you alone.
We'd better leave her alone.
Al@@ though Mary is sick, she will work.
Happy is the man who is contented.
I was bored.
If I were health@@ y, I would be happy.
She has left us.
She asked him for some money.
I'm not really that thirsty.
Have fun with that.
There is something tropical and ex@@ otic about her which form@@ s a sing@@ ul@@ ar contr@@ ast to her cool and un@@ emotion@@ al brother.
Go there tomorrow!
Nobody would listen to me.
I can't prove it, you'll have to take my word for it.
Do you have a sho@@ v@@ el I can borro@@ w?
You have changed since I saw you last year.
E@@ eny, meeny, miny, mo@@ e, catch a tiger by his to@@ e, if he hol@@ l@@ ers let him go, e@@ eny, meeny, miny, mo@@ e. My mother told me to catch the very best one and you are not it.
I'll go first.
How could anyone be so stupi@@ d?
There's no exit.
It's on the sofa.
We're looking for a place to sleep.
There's a du@@ ck on her shirt.
It's easy to have a clear conscience when it's not us@@ ed.
Are you vegetari@@ an?
If you want something to be done right, sometimes you've just got to do it yourself.
The workers are against the new plan.
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
She gave me good advice.
Pr@@ ay for all of us.
My brother depends on me for money.
This isn't where I parked my car.
I want to sort this out once and for all.
Don't let go of my hand@@ , or you'll get lost.
She's strong@@ -@@ wil@@ led.
