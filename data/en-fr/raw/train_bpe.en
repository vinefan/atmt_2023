You should stay in the hospital for tre@@ at@@ ment.
Could you please tell me again who your father is?
Do you have a back@@ up plan?
Everyone started laughing.
I'd better take a look at it.
I even wrote a letter to her.
What's for dinner tonight?
We have way too much work to do.
He is deeply att@@ ach@@ ed to her.
He is not such a nasty fellow as you think.
I'm happy you liked it.
We have come a long way.
This is my favourite subject.
How many languages are spoken world@@ wi@@ de?
In a man@@ n@@ er of speaking, yes.
Now drink up.
I assure you this is about much more than money.
Did you forget to do your home@@ work?
I've got a br@@ and new bike.
Tom knew what Mary had done.
He is hated by all.
I don't bite.
This will only take a secon@@ d.
Tom and Mary are living in France since yesterday.
We lost.
He went into re@@ ha@@ b.
We must think about these plans in terms of what they would cost.
He's feeling much better.
Tom sings in a church cho@@ ir.
He felt uneasy in his father's presence.
Am I the only one who didn't understand what was going on?
The storm did great damage to her property.
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you and your family.
I lost my wife in a traffic accident.
Nothing has gone right all day.
Make ha@@ st@@ e.
You're very timid.
We're all in this together.
He dropped the ancho@@ vi@@ es.
You're out of your mind.
Do you mind if we come in?
It's very col@@ d, this win@@ ter@@ !
This is bad.
As far as I am concerned, I am not against your opinion.
He seldom order@@ s anything new.
I quite co@@ tt@@ oned on to that man.
He came running.
He is not himself today.
It's not going to be easy to finish this job on time.
This is going to happen a lot from now on.
This o@@ il well has been suc@@ ked dr@@ y.
That's told him@@ !
Dan dra@@ gged Linda out of the house and threw her in the stree@@ t.
I'm not tired right now.
You don't understand what's happening.
Now you listen to me!
You'll feel better in a few hours.
I'm very lazy.
You're nu@@ t@@ s!
Tom deserves punish@@ ment.
What do you think happened to Tom?
It's like being in a candy store.
This evening we will go to chur@@ ch.
It's hot today, isn't it?
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Come to help me.
I didn't know Tom was afraid of ghosts.
He is well@@ -@@ li@@ ked.
I added his name to the list.
Thank you for your efforts.
I need to see you in my office.
The costs are too high.
I would like you to think about what you would have done in my place.
Don't mess with me!
I feel very strong@@ ly about that.
She owes me money.
Can you leave me alone?
Tom told me he wasn't happy here.
This little girl lives in Brazil.
I feel like someone just walked over my gra@@ ve.
Give me chapter and ver@@ se.
Can you come over and tal@@ k?
I know that Tom might want to learn how to do that.
Our gar@@ den produced an abun@@ dance of cab@@ bag@@ es last year.
Why don't we talk in your office?
Tom didn't show up for work yesterday.
I must find out who is behind this.
I thought you'd want to meet my family.
I can't stand this hot weather.
Give us the details.
She witnes@@ sed him being killed.
I'll never give up.
I was tra@@ pped in a v@@ ici@@ ous cir@@ c@@ le.

O@@ b@@ vious@@ ly, you volunteer@@ ed.
See life in terms of power.
The weather is good.
Do you really want to win?
Most of them urged him to take the job.
Sami came to give Layla her gift.
Nothing was funny.
I never loved you.
Let's talk man to man.
I can't do that with you because I don't have enough money.
Tom is boring, isn't he?
I didn't sleep long enough.
We are living through a bio@@ di@@ versity crisis.
I know some@@ thing's wrong.
I just don't want to go with you.
Really? I didn't know she was your sister.
He's working at his English.
They live on the floor b@@ ene@@ a@@ th.

Something is wrong with the eng@@ ine of this car.
I was surprised by the news this morning.
Tom gets upset easily.
This man is a leg@@ end.
Enjoy your me@@ al@@ ! Did you already start?
You're a sno@@ b.
I figured I could count on you.
We'd like another bottle of wine.
May I put it down here?
If Tom has a problem with me, he should tell me.
At what time is dinner served?
I asked him for advice.
She is always for@@ getting my phone number.
What has become of him since then?
She doesn't study as hard as her sister.
You would like it.
The price is reas@@ on@@ able.

Run hot water into the bath.
She treated me badly.
May I have your order@@ , please?
The radio is a bit lou@@ d.
Mary is a yo@@ de@@ ler.
He kept on laughing at me.
I could tell you about bee@@ keeping for hour@@ s, but I don't want to bor@@ e you.
Don't all speak at once.
It was very cold.
I'm getting tired of looking at furniture we can't af@@ for@@ d.
He wants you to come home.
You're early.
I found the empty box.
She made him rich.
He was standing at the top of the mountain.
She le@@ an@@ ed towards me.
This is what I wanted.
You remind me of myself when I was your age.
These pieces of furniture are not for sal@@ e.
I love what you've done to this place.
I am learning German.
Please close the door behind you.
Have you made a li@@ st yet?
Without o@@ x@@ y@@ gen@@ , all animals would have disa@@ p@@ pea@@ red long ago.
Wh@@ y's Tom still here?
We need money.
It's my faul@@ t, not yours.
No one is a@@ mu@@ sed.
I wonder why you would like so much to learn English.
While we were having te@@ a, there was an earthquake.
Either they don't want to or they can't.
What is in your hands?
We need you.
I'll just leave.
I went to the market.
It was one of the most rewar@@ ding experiences of my life.
He is responsible for the accident.
I can't believe you're consi@@ dering doing that.
I can think of several reasons.
You might get hurt.
You're the only one who can help.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
Do you really think Tom is happ@@ y?
You've been infe@@ cted.
There were six sheep in the fi@@ el@@ d.

Our teacher often overlooked his name on the list.
Tom still owes me a lot of money.

Be careful!
The population of Japan is larger than that of New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and.
I'd prefer not to eat that.
The price rose.
The pain has les@@ sened a little.
I wish I could explain to you how important this is to me.
Any chance you know where I put my keys?
That's terrible advice.
I've come a long way.
You're all se@@ t?
That's absolute non@@ sen@@ se@@ !
The teacher punished her students for using bad words.
How can you acc@@ use me of such a thing? I would never lay a hand on my child.
Tom is thirsty.
He has a Sou@@ thern accent.
Don't give them to her.
I was ready today.
The problem is the@@ irs.
In times of crisis one should never ide@@ al@@ ise the past.
You can't sit there.
I like to swim in the afternoon.
I left my umbrella in the cab.
I didn't even know you spoke French.
We get together once a year.
That was Tom's cousin.
I'm not sure I'd want to live here.
No one has ever seen Go@@ d.
Some teachers have a great effect on their students.
We're old friends.
We avoid talking about polit@@ ic@@ s.
I am not avail@@ able.
Do you believe in Christi@@ an@@ ity?
None of these cars are mine.
Please mail this letter on your next trip to the post office.
You still have a lot to learn.
I want to get back.
I'm sorry that I couldn't live up to your expect@@ ations.
You can go if you want to.
I am convinced that he is innocent.
Do all of you speak French?
Is this wine from Ar@@ gent@@ in@@ a?
I don't know what Tom and Mary are waiting for.

He is too drunk to drive home.
Ex@@ peri@@ ence is the best teacher.
Tom was on TV yesterday.
Painting is very easy when you do not know how to do it. When you know, it's very difficult.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
How did they get in here?
I wonder if Tom will tell Mary the truth.
I'm sorry to be so late. The meeting completely slipped my mind.
F@@ ood is necessary for life.
That sounds goo@@ d!
We char@@ ter@@ ed a bus.
A@@ s@@ k me again some other time.
I don't want to upset you.
I can't wait.

You've om@@ itted the pre@@ position in this sentence.
Enjoy yourself to the ful@@ le@@ st.
Tom told me that he hadn't done that yet.
I am right.
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that.
Tokyo is a very expensive place to live.
Don't tell me that again.
I'm bored. Let's do something fun.
I'm sure Tom intended to do that.
The firm has its head office in Osak@@ a.
Today, I was with a friend at the swimming pool.
Tom put some o@@ at milk in his coffee.
I made him sweep the floor.
I don't have those answers.

Are you through with your work?

I thought that you were going to wait for me.
Can cats really see in the dar@@ k?

She knows herself well.
How many times have you been in love in your life?
Do you eat rice every day?
Har@@ dly had he entered the room, when she burst into tears.
I'm not as afraid of he@@ igh@@ ts as I used to be.
You'll be safe with her.
How long does it take by car?
Can we get some help?
You must take advantage of the opportunity.
I opened a bottle of red wine.
You have a great imagination.
She volunteered to go to the meeting with him.
She's really smart, isn't she?
You'd better eat everything that's on your pl@@ ate.
I admit I was surprised.
When will you return?
You can't just come in here and start ordering people around.
What is the use of philosoph@@ y?
I was us@@ her@@ ed to my seat.
I had something plan@@ ned.
Tom has travel@@ ed around the world.
Tom never gave up.
I don't really want to have another child.
The nu@@ n pra@@ yed and crossed her@@ self.
I think I'd rather not know.
She advised him where he should sta@@ y.
New blan@@ kets were distributed to the poor.
Tell them what happened.

It isn't expensive.

Here's where the fun begins.
Could you add me?
I suppose we have nothing to lose.
I wanted you to see that I'm not all that bad.
I'm afraid that Tom is involved in a crime.
If your answer is corre@@ ct, it follows that mine is wrong.
Tom and Mary had their honeymoon in a foreign land.
We tried to cheer her up.
They burned all the docu@@ ments.
You're the same age as my girlfriend.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
No one believed you.

These aren't my keys.
We are having lunch.
A growing child requires more food.
How long did they live in England?
How is your daughter?
It's lunch time.
See what happens when you give people advic@@ e?
It's time for us to get ready.

I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternati@@ ves.
You don't have to come.
I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
I was completely devast@@ ated.
He turned his though@@ ts toward home.

She advised him to talk about his life in the United States.
She turned her eyes away.
I'm sure I'll be fine.
Where have you been up to now?
You never have any doub@@ ts, do you?
Tom burst out laughing.
I can not afford to buy a used car.
We caught him red@@ -@@ han@@ ded.
I'm sorry I had to leave you alone.
I had nothing to do with that.
I never go out.
In about ten minutes, you'll find out more.
I am asking you for patience.
It'll be hard to find a replac@@ ement for him.
It's calm.
She was hit by a car.
Tom would've made the same decision I'm making if he were in my shoes.
I have a large bed@@ room.
Let the cat out.
I finally met her.
I'll go w@@ herever you want me to go.
It is less cold today than it was yesterday.
There have been a lot of complaints about the way Tom beha@@ ves.
We're not invited.
You need to fil@@ ter the out@@ put of this command in order to disp@@ lay only the lines with "@@ foo@@ " inside.
He has a daughter who is very pretty.
Don't throw the ball near the windows.
The Earth is like a ball with a large mag@@ net inside.
That's just what I needed.
Promise me you won't tell her.
I don't care who we give it to.
We want further inform@@ ation.
I could hardly end@@ ure the pain.
Don't back away.
This doesn't look good.
I caught a beautiful butter@@ f@@ ly.
French was the language of diplom@@ ac@@ y.
I can't tell you how angry that makes me.
What do you love? What do you ha@@ te@@ ?
How much is your hour@@ ly pay?
How could I lie to you?
He was a French@@ man. I could tell by his accent.
I will never understand.
We'll respon@@ d.
As my father and my grandfather have many si@@ bl@@ ings, there are a lot of kids in our family.
Did you see him go out?
Sami has been married six times.
My father does not eat much fruit.
The ver@@ b โ@@ to be@@ โ has an irregu@@ lar con@@ ju@@ g@@ ation in all languages.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
Do I have to go now?
A home is more than a mere building.
Have you already eat@@ en?
It's really awesome.
He always takes L@@ รฉ@@ a on his lap to read her a story.
I don't go out much.
Tom is not a true warrior.
Tom needs lots of cou@@ rage and perseverance because he has to pay attention to so many things at the same time.
I'm reading a letter.
It must've cost a fortune.
Thank you for inv@@ iting me to dinner.
I want to know what you're thinking.
Don't be afraid of the dog who bar@@ ks, but be afraid of the one who is silent and wa@@ gs its ta@@ il.
What did you just say?
They make a great team.
The separatists think that I'm kidding.
The bicycle is mine.
We think we've found a way to help you.
I am applying for a job.
That's not what happened here.
I ate some peanu@@ ts.
I use the Internet as a resour@@ ce for my re@@ sear@@ ch.
He said he was poor.
She thinks about him all the time.
He has his own room.
I don't know who else to turn to for help.
This dra@@ wing took me five minutes, but I took sixty years to get there.
I don't want to live by your rules.
I didn't stop.
She took the news cal@@ m@@ ly.
How's everybody doing?
We're wasting time.
What did you get hit with?
C@@ ars are expensive.
They were not impressed.
To tell the truth, I drove my father's car without his permission.
He is Japanese to the bone.
We gotta have all the data in there.
She doesn't want him to buy an expensive enga@@ gement r@@ ing.
I think it's time for me to get my own place.
You know what you must do.
He is twice as old as she is.
I can't be seen with you.
Is this what you were looking for?
Write in the date yourself.
There is no hope.
Cut that out!
I have to put my shoes on.
Tom is an archite@@ ct, right?
Were you busy?
I defeated the warrior.
You are not the only one responsible for it, I am too.
I never wanted this.
I try to travel with only one suit@@ case.
You're wasting both of our time.
Ear@@ ly ex@@ plor@@ ers used the stars for na@@ vi@@ g@@ ation.
His salary is too low to support his family on.
This is a very time@@ -@@ consu@@ ming task.
Your phone is r@@ inging again.
Tom wants to marry Mary.
Who asked you to do that?
Have a piece of pie.
Lon@@ g, long a@@ go, there lived an old man in a village.
Let's walk a little faster.
I know exactly where I am.
My mom bought me this to@@ y when I was eight years old.
I hope we're not making a huge mistake.
Breakfast is ser@@ ved.
This is illeg@@ al.
I'm not in the mood to go for a walk.
I'd like to see that r@@ ing, please.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
We managed to swim across the river.
Mary wants to breast@@ feed her baby, but she's not making enough milk.
Who is he talking to?
What's the best cure for lonel@@ in@@ es@@ s?
Would you mind speaking more slow@@ ly?
Do you want to stay here all night?
Tom poin@@ ted out my mistake.
The pat@@ ro@@ l@@ man moti@@ oned me to pull over.
I'll send you a postcard.
I'd like to get you both to help me.
There's nothing there.
I know that you're very angry.
You should try to have fun.
I never thought I'd see Tom again.
Don't worry. It's easy.
It's against the law.
She has no less than ten children.
All that g@@ li@@ ster@@ s is not gold.
One of the guar@@ ds is dead.
You owe it to yourself to do it.
Parents must provi@@ de their children with proper food and clo@@ thing.
I just want you to know how sorry I am.
Don't beat about the bush.
Would you like to sleep a little long@@ er?
You are supposed to obey the law.
Whatever you do, don't push that butt@@ on.
I love the out@@ fit you're wearing.
Are you acc@@ using me of che@@ ating?
You can't drive now. You've been drinking.
I'm sorry, but I can't resi@@ st.
"@@ Does she have a dog@@ ?" "No, she do@@ es@@ n@@ 't."
Tom wanted to see him.
This house is mine.
We were very careful.
I think it's OK.
Follow your hear@@ t, for it never lies.
Do you have any small change?
Don't stare at me like that.
I wanted your opinion.
My fa@@ ther, who is now working in America, wrote us a letter last week.
Why did you come home so late?
The contract is in the bag@@ , so let's go out and celebr@@ ate.
According to fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es, cats have n@@ ine lives.
He was spea@@ king.
I'm not going to Spain on holiday.
Tom didn't know whether he should do that or not.
This broken vase cannot be repaired.
We must have faith in the presi@@ dent.
How did you get into our room?
We had to les@@ sen the impact of the err@@ atic supp@@ lies.
He has not written to them for a long time.
I can understand what she is saying.
Do whatever you like.
I was in all day.
It looks like a du@@ ck.
We cannot rule out the possibility that civil war will break out in that country.
I called him, but a girl answered the phone.
Tom was watching him s@@ ow sal@@ ad.
If you don't want me to go, I won@@ 't.
"@@ Should I meas@@ ure the fl@@ our out@@ ?" "@@ You can eye@@ ball it if you wan@@ t."
S@@ ig@@ n this.
Whose book is this?
He danced like a leaf in the autumn win@@ d.
You must be cau@@ ti@@ ous.
She promised to meet him at the coffee shop.
He's very polite.
Pickpockets may operate in this area.
This hat is too small. Please show me another one.
They forgot to lock the door.
Speaking English isn't eas@@ y, but interesting.
We need to remember that.
We must talk her out of this foo@@ lish plan.
Yes, as far as I know.
I was tre@@ sp@@ as@@ sing.
It's cold outside.
Please beat the eggs.
I know it's un@@ reali@@ stic to expect Tom to do that.
A whale is a mammal.
I wrote down his phone number on a scra@@ p of paper.
I hope it's not just a curi@@ os@@ ity.
I can't imagine my life without Tom.
In@@ spired by her teacher@@ s, P@@ ha@@ ra@@ mp is going to start her so@@ lar career tomorrow.
I lost the bet.

Americans eat special foods on Th@@ ank@@ s@@ gi@@ ving.
We've had a lot of complaints about how you treat your class@@ mat@@ es.

You don't know who I am.
Not everything is about you.
Ro@@ om@@ s are black.
You don't need to turn up your ther@@ most@@ at when it's cold outside.
Tom is standing over there near the fire@@ place.
Do you mind if I turn down the TV@@ ?
I tried that.
Tom went to my room.
Why are you busy today?
When he ran into difficul@@ ti@@ es, he asked his parents for help.
Where did you learn this?
Do you have a ticke@@ t?
I go to the park.
You could hear a pin drop.
Anybody can make a mistake.
She helped me out countless times.
Let's wait and see how things go.
His wife opened the door for him.
It is not you but her that he wants to marry.
That made me very sad.
I don't have time to go to the movies.
I want to pay with a check.
There is little milk in the j@@ ar.
I don't think I said that.
I'll teach you what you need to know.
It would be so cool if I could speak ten languages!
We decla@@ red war.
She crossed her legs.
We need to find an effective metho@@ d.
She is not ashamed of her mis@@ conduct.
The field was rank with we@@ ed@@ s.
To rule a country is no easy task.
I rarely go to the movies.
You should not wear a fu@@ r coat.
I think you're a geni@@ us.
I'd like you to meet my husband.

He has big problems.
Har@@ b@@ in is very cold.
I caught a cold two days ago.
I'm here not because of that.
She doesn't know how to ride a bike.

Did we miss anything?
I couldn't do this without your help.

It took me more than two hours to translate a few p@@ ag@@ es of English.
It's getting harder for me to concentrate.
I'm not cre@@ ative.
The books were so valuable that they were handled with the greatest care.
They have lost a lot.
Loo@@ ks like we bar@@ ked up the wrong tree.
I have questions.
I didn't start all this.
I wish you could have come with me.
As a matter of fact, all great discover@@ ers have been regarded as drea@@ mer@@ s.
Thank you, I'd like to stay in your house.
I promise that you won't be disappointed.
Can you drive manual?
Tom seems very happy.
Show me how to do that.
I messed up.
I think I did something wrong.
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore.
He's a chain smo@@ ker.
P@@ eas@@ an@@ ts often have a secon@@ d@@ ary activity to au@@ g@@ ment their income.

Could you please tell me again how many times you've been here?
If you wanted to improve your Spanish, you shouldn't have come to Ch@@ ile.
I know you like to travel.
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong.
When did he come here?
I'll keep this cake for myself.
Don't talk back to me like that.
This summer we'll go to the mountains and to the sea.
As far as I know, he has never come on time.
He aven@@ ged the mur@@ der of his father.
My watch loses ten minutes a day.
He is completely be@@ so@@ tted with her.
Let's do it your way.
It's so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air condition@@ ed house.
I was fal@@ se@@ ly ac@@ cu@@ sed.
He didn't know how to ex@@ press himself.
Tom said Mary was happy.
Someone was killed.
She will make us a nice dinner.
You're sure there's no way?
I heard them coming.
I had a headache, so I couldn't do that.
It's ahead of schedule.
Tom rarely hu@@ gs Mary anymore.
She didn't want him to play po@@ ker.
When we look at other places in the univer@@ se, it could very well be that photo@@ sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic life is the exce@@ ption.

The house closest to here is two miles away.
Her age quali@@ fi@@ es her for the job.
He acted like a lun@@ at@@ ic.
They can't do that.

I could really make things hard for you, you know.
You've risked enough.
You knew that already, didn't you?
I gave my brother a dictionary.
If I'd only taken your advic@@ e!
She's well stacked.
Sami thinks he did very well in the exam.
I didn't study at all yesterday.
You can't leave us like this.
One of my pleasures is watching TV.
We need to get out of here.
Were there any stars in the sk@@ y?
Tom apologized.
I just wanted to see if I could do it.
The fo@@ g is growing th@@ ick@@ er.

He isn't rich, but he's happy.
I'm just looking out for myself.
He lac@@ ks tac@@ t.
We were concer@@ ned.
Achieving a nice weld bead is not within everyone's reach!
It was not a complete victory.
We elected Tom captain of the team.
I'm very sorry I got home so late.
F@@ un@@ n@@ y!
I can't do that.
She handed me a postcard.
I just have to do something.
Nobody insul@@ ts my country.
Do you have any kind of alibi?
I think you would like it here.
His answer was favor@@ able.
How many col@@ ours are there?
The language of friend@@ ship is not words but meanings.
If you want my help, you'll have to ask for it.
I spent a week with a P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian family from G@@ az@@ a.
We're working to fix this bug.
Let me congratulate you on your engagement.
A t@@ sun@@ ami is com@@ ing, so please be on the aler@@ t.
Why did you tell him that?
Tom was aw@@ fully bored.
The nu@@ ll hypothesis st@@ ates how often a sa@@ m@@ pl@@ ing error alone will produ@@ ce results that are different than a foreca@@ st.
At the party there was food in abundance.
I want you to speak fr@@ ank@@ ly.
They are seeing their uncle tomorrow.

It is in the restaurant where Dan eats lunch.
They gang@@ ed up on him.
You don't understand what's happening.
Tom rum@@ maged through the draw@@ er, looking for a penc@@ il.
Do you need a ride home later?
I took the little girl by the hand.
My father spends a lot of time on his hobby.
You che@@ ated.
Do you know how to play the piano?
I wanted to make sure you were all right.
You've found it.
I don't understand your resistance.
Mon@@ days aren't good for me.
The weather today is worse than yesterday.
I plan to have lunch with him.
She is wat@@ ering the flowers.
I think Tom eats too much me@@ at.
What direction are you going?
I wish there were a French translation of this book.
Down came the rain in torrents.
She tried to com@@ fort him, but he kept crying.
That won't change anything.
The most wasted day of all is that on which we have not laughed.
The way touri@@ sts dress off@@ ends local standar@@ ds of pro@@ pri@@ ety.
We can't give up.
It's a misunderstanding.
They want someone to help them.

That lies outside my area of study.
My uncle has a house in Italy.
She turned down my offer.
Tom has three boys and a girl.
My boyfriend looks like your girlfriend.
Tom was in the shower.
We'll meet at my house.
You're the teacher.
We've lost faith in human@@ ity.

A wom@@ an's strength is in her tongue.
C@@ lo@@ th@@ es are behind me.
Some of the photos have been taken at the risk of life.
That box is heavy.
Where were you born?
It was very different from what I had imagin@@ ed.
Do you have every@@ thing?
The reason is clear.

How did you get into our room?
Everybody had a hard time.
I'd like some sugar, please.
I am trying to ju@@ gg@@ le.
Sami used to wear glasses all the time.
I just wanted to ask you a few questions.

Here we are.
The society in which they live is very different from our own.
She wrote a lot of poems.
I want to talk to you.

I painted a picture for you.
He likes to talk about himself.

She cut the cake in two.
You handled that well.
I didn't know why Tom didn't want us there.
Let's drink to his success.

Do you know her at all?
I can't hear you very well.
Sami isn't jo@@ king.

If you were in my place, what would you do?

Do you like Moscow?
He's hell@@ -@@ b@@ ent on fin@@ ding out who killed his daughter.

He was killed.
No one was in the room.
I can't believe I'm telling you this.
Language refle@@ cts daily experience.
Tom began to shi@@ ver viol@@ ent@@ ly.

Fe@@ min@@ ine logi@@ c is not always log@@ ic@@ al.
When we started out, our band could only find small clu@@ bs in small citi@@ es that would hire us.
You should respect the rules your parents set for you.

I told you I have a girlfriend.
I need you right now.
Sami saw Layla hur@@ r@@ ying.
Leave our house.
I'll lend it to you.
I may need to move on.
I believe that he's happy.

They set out for New York.
I despise them.
My cat slept next to me.
Forgive me.
The floor is covered with a thick car@@ pe@@ t.

We're lucky to be alive.
You can drive a car@@ , can't you?
As soon as we got to the la@@ ke, we started swimming.
Yesterday, he told me the truth.
Gi@@ ving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I know because I've done it thous@@ and@@ s of times.
The dog is thirsty.
I heard that a gay pri@@ est had been promo@@ ted to the rank of b@@ is@@ hop@@ , but it turned out to be a fab@@ ri@@ c@@ ation.
The food isn't very good here.
What do you mean@@ , "I don't like it@@ "?
He had long hair last year.
Your question has no answer.
How aw@@ ful@@ !
I hate it when my parents fight.
He who does not work does not have the right to eat.
Don't be a stranger.
I know Tom is all right now.
Tom said he would try.
We need to correct those mista@@ ken assumpti@@ ons.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
Sami was five minutes away.
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow.
She loved her mother de@@ ar@@ ly.
I ple@@ aded not guil@@ ty.
We can't postpone the meeting.
You aren't invited.
Long live the geri@@ o@@ crac@@ y!
She cannot play the piano.
Men only think about one thing.
He didn't do that out of mean@@ ness, but rather out of ab@@ sent@@ -min@@ de@@ dness.
Yes, I am married.
Never talk to strangers.
How could you do that?
I had to go back.
I have a predi@@ le@@ ction for beef.
You have everything.

I want to see it.
They must be crazy to believe such nonsense.
I want you to be quiet.
Co@@ tton absor@@ bs water.
Get back to where you started.
I had to work on Sunday.
You guys su@@ ck.
Who's going to cook for us?
What language were they speak@@ ing?
Never tell lies.
Both alternati@@ ves are possible.
Maybe I should also add sentences without translation@@ s? It is a very fast way of impro@@ ving the popular@@ ity of one's own language.
Do you want to bet on that?
We made sacrifices.
I had only one drink.
I've chosen her to be my wife.
I can't kiss you the way you want to be kis@@ sed.
Stop t@@ wi@@ sting my arm@@ !
If he sends me any letters, I just tear them up and throw them away.
I was warned.
Sooner or later, Tom will likely agree to help us.
This is longer than any other bridge in the world.
What's the teacher explain@@ ing?
We'd like separate che@@ cks.
Who wouldn't want to live here?
We're crossing the border.
Who is nex@@ t?
Are you sure you're warm enough?
I don't know who my ancestors are. Our paper@@ s got lost during the F@@ loo@@ d.
Sit down and shut up.
It'll rain for sure.
It's not on the men@@ u@@ .
Tom is the only one who doesn't know.
I went to the super@@ market.
Droplets are falling on my laptop computer.
I am sure.
I believe him to be intelligent.
I study English at home.
I'm still a memb@@ er.
This kind of work makes me hungry.
Smoking is bad for your health.
Indeed, dwar@@ f tos@@ sing is an Olympic spor@@ t!
Yes, I'm afraid so.
You should keep your promises.
I just want to be perfect.
I'm glad I invited you.
There is only one truth.
Man has a great ca@@ pac@@ ity to adapt to environ@@ mental changes.
I wonder what has become of him after he went to America.
I don't have much interest in cooking.
Tom asked me to be here.
You look g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous in that dress.
He isn't dumber than you.
I still can't believe I'm going to be on your team.
Come and keep me company.
Why are you pic@@ king a fi@@ ght with me?
His kindness touched my heart.
He studies bio@@ log@@ y very hard.
My uncle is rich.
To be perfe@@ ct she lac@@ ked just one defe@@ ct.
I hear him fall@@ ing.
You don't have to be a victi@@ m.
Which way is the beach?
I just need you to help me.
Can I have some more ri@@ ce, please?
Don't talk rubbish@@ !
Sami lived very close to the loc@@ ation where Layla's body was f@@ ound.
The suspect is a cau@@ cas@@ ian femal@@ e.
He painted a dog.
Where did you hide the foo@@ d?
I get c@@ happ@@ ed li@@ ps every winter.
They decei@@ ved us.
My feet are cold.
Mary accepted everything without complaining.
He's an ex@@ or@@ ci@@ st.
It's your turn to sing.
They were scolded by the teacher.
Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
I'll never do this again.
I survi@@ ved.
This glass isn't mine.
It's hard to choose.
My dog has cancer.
Do you remember the day this picture was taken?
What did she do to you?
Cre@@ ating Tatoeba was a good idea.
Are you happy here?
She che@@ ated on the test.
Can I speak to you a moment?
They stood on the hill@@ top.
I've never felt like this before.
What's your favorite skin care product?
You can borrow three books at a time.
I'm in absolutely total agre@@ ement.
This car is hi@@ s.
I'm sure Tom and Mary will be tired when they get home.
I wouldn't go with you for anything.
He made up the whole story.
You're finished already.

Please do as it seems best to you.
Tom has enough money to buy the house he wants.
The librar@@ ian said we needed to be quiet.
Ber@@ n@@ ard of Char@@ tre@@ s used to say that we are like dwar@@ f@@ s on the shoul@@ ders of gi@@ ant@@ s, so that we can see more than the@@ y, and things at a great@@ er distance, not by vir@@ tu@@ e of any shar@@ p@@ ness of sight on our par@@ t, or any physical dist@@ in@@ ction@@ , but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant si@@ ze.

I know where you live.
I think what you say is true.
