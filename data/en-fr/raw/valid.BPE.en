I've completely re@@ cover@@ ed.
I wish he had gone on to university.
I left Tom three messages.
You are her patient without ever having met her.

The rock was moved by dynam@@ ite.
My mother vis@@ its the dentist@@ 's every other day to get her teeth fix@@ ed.

I'd like one tick@@ et, please.
I know it's wr@@ on@@ g, but I'll do it any@@ way.
They spent the afternoon around the pool.
He had never cancel@@ ed an appointment before.
He w@@ ished she had more time.
She is h@@ an@@ di@@ c@@ apped by poor hear@@ ing.
Does that s@@ care you?
But for your help, he would have failed.
Are we done?
Why don't you let me take a look?
I am from E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ t.
The girl saw it, too.
Nobody was listening to the speech.
I'll be right behind you.
Did you actually see the ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent?
Last night I tos@@ sed my cookies.
It's a p@@ ity that you can't come.
This doesn't f@@ it.
I'll risk it.
She is busy pre@@ par@@ ing for an examin@@ ation.
Have yourself a drink.
He repaired his watch by himself.
My son can ne@@ ither read nor write yet.
It's as good as done.
How did you handle the s@@ it@@ u@@ ation?
Does he do any sport@@ s?
I can't believe your mom let you go.
He seemed to like that.
Sami and Layla were e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly awai@@ ting the arriv@@ al of their bab@@ y.
Tom couldn't believe what had happened.
It's as if I had always known how it all was going to end.
I saw the fil@@ e.
The cinema is bur@@ st@@ ing at the se@@ am@@ s.
This job will call for a lot of money.
She is a doctor and also an al@@ p@@ in@@ ist.
In a dem@@ ocrac@@ y, it's important for the press to be independent.
It seems that they're bor@@ ed of married life.
The dog destro@@ yed the sofa.
As@@ k T@@ r@@ ang if he's going out this evening.
The food was fing@@ er@@ -@@ lic@@ king good.
This is always the way it has been.
Some people are just weir@@ d.
We like Tom.
We had a secret meeting.
I'm off to the g@@ y@@ m.
Do you care for class@@ ical music@@ ?
Everyone is uni@@ que.
I hear music.
We really enjoyed our@@ sel@@ ves.
I can't pay the rent.
Tom almost always ignor@@ es my advice.
I want you to lay back and rela@@ x.
Th@@ at@@ 'll make me happy.
L@@ ook@@ !
Why don't we go out and get dr@@ un@@ k?
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
I wanted to speak with you first.
This room is cold.
The watch doesn't work.
I didn't think that you'd notic@@ ed.
G@@ e@@ or@@ ge sent me a birthday card.
He worked for a rich man.
Hey, be careful with that@@ !
Do you think you and I are comp@@ ati@@ ble@@ ?
I cannot help lov@@ ing her in spite of her many faults.
I'm not going to work.
The soccer game will be play@@ ed, even if it rains.
She's int@@ ent on going to New York to study fashi@@ on.
I don't have that kind of money.
Mon@@ keys do not compl@@ ain about not having been made into men.
What do you call this animal in Japanese?
I'll turn it into a house.
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
This is the same ne@@ ck@@ l@@ a@@ ce that I lost yesterday.
We'd be very interested in what you think.
The r@@ at was killed by Tom with a stick.
The in@@ hab@@ it@@ ants of the is@@ land are tall and strong.
I've always wanted to visit Tur@@ key.
I had a tooth@@ ache yesterday.
You have no cause for ang@@ er.
All pre@@ po@@ si@@ tions take the n@@ om@@ in@@ ative.
Is that French?
The bar@@ om@@ eter is fall@@ ing. It is going to rain.
If there's anything I can do to help, please let me know.
I have a feeling you'll be a very good lawyer.
Some people are reading some magazines on the train.
Let's take a trip.
I thought I was about to be cap@@ tu@@ red so I ran as fast as I coul@@ d.
You don't owe me anything.
Is sugar can@@ e a fruit or a veget@@ able?
I bought a cam@@ era for thirty dollars.
The house stood on the h@@ ill.
It's kind of com@@ fort@@ ing.
I'm load@@ ed.
How did you meet him?
I thought about you the other day.
He reads French.
I slept n@@ ine hours.
No one trus@@ ts her.
Why don't we talk about something el@@ se?
The may@@ or ad@@ min@@ is@@ ters the af@@ fai@@ r@@ s of the city.
Tom is a timi@@ d young man.
She wonder@@ ed where Sam was and what he was doing.
We're on the same side.
Things are only going to get worse.
Nothing happened to Mary. She just forgot to c@@ all.
That is the thing that concer@@ ns you.
The fishing boat that had been mis@@ sing returned to its port saf@@ ely.
I want to stay in the house.
Are you afraid of death?
Tomorrow will be even war@@ mer than today.
We eat so we may live.
When is good for you?
My father was sad for the whole day as he had lost his wal@@ let.
I don't care how much you say you love me. I know your feelings for her haven't changed.
He left home early in the morning so he wouldn't miss the train.
I had no idea it would put you to so much trouble.
What the fuck is going on here?
The o@@ str@@ ic@@ h has w@@ ings, but it cannot f@@ ly.
I was a bit disappointed.
I lost your phone number.
A rope was thro@@ wn into the water.
It being Sun@@ day, the shop was closed.
Jean and Kate are tw@@ ins.
Who did this?
How many children do you have?
It wouldn't surprise me.
Are you seriously thinking about not going?
He told the boss some cock@@ am@@ am@@ ie story about being sick and need@@ ing days off from work.
Read it to me.
Is that all you can talk about - the Intern@@ et?
I'll call you back later.
He was chosen cap@@ t@@ ain.
Thank you very much.
She doesn't understand s@@ ar@@ cas@@ m.
You are either with us, or against us.
You know what they say.
Excuse me, l@@ a@@ di@@ es!
Tom speaks French as well as Mary does.
I have a lawyer.
A mas@@ si@@ ve earthquake of magnitude 8@@ .@@ 8 hit the Japanese is@@ land@@ s today.

The conclusion reached by a study is "@@ People who think their feet are sm@@ ell@@ y, have sm@@ el@@ ly fe@@ et@@ ; people who think they aren@@ '@@ t, don@@ '@@ t."
He is fond of pain@@ ting.
P@@ oli@@ tici@@ ans never tell us their in@@ ner though@@ ts.
I don't know who she is.
I've got work to do here.
I've enjoyed talking to you.
Her job is to ty@@ pe.
Tom was ab@@ duc@@ ted.
You can't d@@ ance, can you?
I accept your ap@@ ology.
Should I be talking to Tom?
I need to know where you are.
What did I say yesterday?
He speaks as if he were an exper@@ t.
We have a good team and everyone knows it.
I'm watching the mark@@ et closely.
I have no imagination.
She is good at ski@@ ing.
Keep driving.
I don't need your help anymore.
I'll see to it.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
She is P@@ i@@ er@@ ro@@ t's sister.
The lake is de@@ ep@@ est here.
He was sent@@ en@@ c@@ ed to prison.
An experienc@@ ed he@@ al@@ er can lif@@ t cur@@ ses and dis@@ pe@@ l evil eyes.
I didn't know what to say to her.
Don't open your umbrella in the h@@ all.
Let's go to an all@@ -@@ you@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ eat place and have a big dinner.
Are you attemp@@ ting to bri@@ be me?
Your critic@@ ism is un@@ fair.
I spent the whole day reading a nov@@ el.
Do Mar@@ ti@@ ans speak English?
I'm getting sleep@@ y. I should've gone to bed earlier last night.
We picked flowers together.
It's no trouble at all.
I liked working with you.
G@@ ood@@ night.
I was surprised by the news this morning.
He re@@ jec@@ ted our offer.
Tom found a job as a mechan@@ ic.
I'll have a n@@ ap after lunch.
If he asks me that questi@@ on, I won't answer.
I'm not goo@@ d@@ -@@ looking.
Were you aw@@ ake at 2:@@ 30 last night?
Why don't you stay a while?
He ran to his mother in the library.
Some water, please.
Would you please slow down@@ ?
There's room inside.
Tom was reading a book while listening to music.
Tom needed your help.
We're all in this together.
May I try it on?
Close your eyes and tell me what you hear.
How does Tom plan to help?
He's addicted to j@@ un@@ k food.
You're all alone.
They appro@@ ve.
We're ready to leave.
I can drive to Boston and back on one t@@ ank of g@@ as.
Why don't you pull over@@ ?
Why don't you meet me out front in a few minutes?
Sami feels so scar@@ ed.
It is necessary for you to stop smoking.
I've never come across such a strange case.
The company has hard and fast rules against lat@@ en@@ ess.
You gotta get more organized.
She's a yo@@ g@@ a instru@@ ct@@ or.
Nobody ever laugh@@ s at my jokes.
It's hard to do that.
Once a teacher, always a teacher.
Tom was playing golf that morning.
Does your dog bit@@ e?
I just wanted to see what would happen.
B@@ re@@ ath@@ e, dam@@ n you!
What he said made us angry.
I'll wait for you in my room.
I'm not your serv@@ ant.
I don't know whether to cr@@ y or to laugh@@ .
How come you didn't call me last night?
What did you do with that?
A@@ dd@@ ing up numb@@ ers is very up@@ lif@@ ting.
Can I make copi@@ es?
You won't die today.
I hid it somewhere.
Sami has been sick.
Are you still upset about what happened?
She used mar@@ gar@@ ine in@@ stead of but@@ ter.
I'll drive you somewhere.
Tom is ob@@ st@@ in@@ ate.
We have to learn all the songs before the end of the week.
Would you like to visit the cit@@ y?
This gu@@ y's great at pit@@ ching cur@@ v@@ e@@ balls.
One week@@ end all of the ho@@ tel@@ s in the city were full because there was a large con@@ ven@@ tion.
I didn't see Tom yesterday.
We still have a few weeks left.
She got all fl@@ us@@ tered when the boy she likes came over to talk to her.
There's less of it, but no less to it.
That hat becomes you.
How long does it take to walk from here to the city h@@ all?
He dream@@ ed about his home.
They have a ten@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old son.
He was leaving then.
I'll be home by mi@@ d@@ night at the lat@@ est.
I don't think they al@@ low that.
Come again?
I saw the cake you m@@ ade.
Tom and Mary have decided to get married in Oc@@ to@@ b@@ er.
Where are your friends going?
As the door slid open@@ , he almost fell onto the plat@@ form.
Can you use a compu@@ ter?
That's a lot of cas@@ h.
He's not a bad person.
If I tell him the truth, she will never forgive me.
You should have seen her.
Some day we'll take a trip to India.
What time do you want me to pick you up?
You got what you want@@ ed, didn't you?
I can't walk anymore.
I@@ ran is not I@@ ra@@ q@@ .
His deb@@ ts amount to two milli@@ on dollars.
Tom's eyes were full of tears.
What is to@@ day@@ 's dat@@ e?
I've missed you so mu@@ ch@@ , Tom.
Should I tell him that I like him or that I love him?
I have nothing to fear.
I just inv@@ ented a new word@@ -@@ pro@@ c@@ ess@@ or en@@ ab@@ ling to pronounce them back@@ ward@@ s.
The old man started to lau@@ gh s@@ ad@@ ly.
I'm applying for a job.
Who will correct my mistak@@ es?
Do you think it was easy for me?
I scre@@ am@@ ed but nobody could hear me.
Can anyone dri@@ ve?
I am very ill at ease with strangers.
Do you want me to tell Tom that we won't do that?
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
Don't look@@ !
Why don't you love me?
Tom wants to buy a bas@@ s guit@@ ar@@ , but he doesn't have enough money.
I know you see it, but are you really looking at it?
I cannot put up with her behav@@ i@@ or.
Any of you can do it.
I remember what I saw.
They admitted that they@@ 'd li@@ ed.
I don't like swimming in poo@@ l@@ s.
Can you understand the meaning of this sent@@ ence?
The man was hiding in a den@@ se forest.
I know that this is weir@@ d.
That would make sense.
No one had seen anything.
I have no si@@ bl@@ ings.
What's the gold@@ en ru@@ le?
He can hardly speak any English.
I had my watch m@@ ended.
We can help you.
Are you involved in poli@@ tic@@ s?
B@@ low out the cand@@ les.
I wasn't entirely sure myself.
You don't have to lie.
It was a beautiful night.
I think you made the right choice.
The truth is I told a lie.
Tom has the experience necessary.
How do you stop this?
You have too many ir@@ ons in the fire.
But it's me who should thank you.
He came while I was still asleep.
I took over the business from Fa@@ ther.
O@@ il is expensive.
Where did Tom buy it?
I bought a house.
Do you know who we are?
It's as old as the world.
Dan announ@@ c@@ ed that he and Linda were getting divorc@@ ed.
I have a vis@@ a.
It will be a great pleasure for me to translate the story and to read it to you.
What's with the lugg@@ ag@@ e?
Something is asked of me.
It's like being a ki@@ d in a candy store.
M@@ ath@@ s is a good subject.
You really speak French well.
For exam@@ pl@@ e, more people are choo@@ sing to live together and have children without getting married.
Are you seriously thinking about going?
It was a pleasure meeting you, Tom.
If you don't eat@@ , you'll die.
I don't know why Tom doesn't like Boston.
I don't have the right e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment.
I ran outside and the door locked itself behind me.
It would be coun@@ ter@@ -@@ producti@@ ve to do such a thing.
What do you want?
I'm waiting impati@@ ently.
S@@ p@@ ino@@ z@@ a was a p@@ an@@ the@@ ist.
I like both sci@@ ence and ma@@ th.
We're not certain of that yet.
I know it's not impossible.
I work in the morning.
Tom has requ@@ ested my assistance.
Do you want to get us both kil@@ led?
They all speak French.
Why are you so good at expl@@ ain@@ ing thing@@ s?
No one will stop me.
I'm a tr@@ ai@@ ne@@ e.
How much are you being paid to do this?
She was loved by everybody in the village.
Where do you train your stud@@ ents?
Have you seen my cam@@ er@@ a?
I hear you were gr@@ oun@@ ded.
This book is too large to go in my pocket.
Could you please over@@ look it this time?
When I was your age, I had a boy@@ friend.
I hate that guy.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't have a brother.
He borrowed the car from his friend.
This TV was made in China.
I feel sick every morning.
You should know yourself.
He took this photo.
Would you like to read this magazin@@ e?
He took charge of the firm after his father's death.
Tom and I usually talked to each other in French.
I filled up the vase with water.
It doesn't matter who says that, it's not true.
This is how I made it.
Do you know how to play ch@@ ess?
This bicycle is mine. Y@@ ours is over there.
It's an emerg@@ en@@ c@@ y!
For me, the real world is just a fic@@ tion.
Speaking of fil@@ m@@ s, why not go to the cinema tonight?
Tom felt his phone vi@@ br@@ ate.
Will it be fine tomorrow?
I never really gave it much thought.
Tom likes living in Boston.
Any@@ thing you want@@ , my de@@ ar.
She attracted me at first sight.
That is the fun@@ ni@@ est jo@@ ke that I have ever he@@ ard.
He promised to provi@@ de information.
I'm taking care of it. You can rela@@ x. You can rely on me.
Are you still sick@@ ?
I've just spoken to your French teacher and he says you're doing well in his class.
Every@@ body's in a hur@@ ry these days.
She likes to go to the library.
Everyone is waiting in the other room.
It matters to me.
The cold air re@@ vi@@ v@@ ed Tom.
Are you out of your mind?
She temp@@ ted him.
Everyone can make a difference in their own lives and ther@@ e@@ by colle@@ cti@@ v@@ ely make the world a better place for themselves and others around them.
You're not in a hurry, are you?
Let's come back to it later.
I should talk to Tom.
You'd better stay with me.
Once upon a time there lived an em@@ per@@ or who was a great con@@ qu@@ er@@ or@@ , and re@@ ig@@ ned over more countries than anyone in the world.
Can you come to the party?
Don't s@@ plas@@ h me!
Tom hardly spoke any French when I first met him.
I don't have enough money for my trip.
There's only one pretty child in the world, and every mother has it.
J@@ ac@@ ques made it clear that he wanted to meet Mr G@@ ag@@ n@@ on.
Everyone is free to contribu@@ te.
Tom was mu@@ gg@@ ed on his way home from work.
They made sure nobody could see them.
A guy nearly ran into us.
I think we have some un@@ finished business.
I've lost my f@@ ill@@ ing.
Do you think that's tru@@ e?
If you would be a good read@@ er, read@@ ; if a writ@@ er, write.
I hate those spi@@ der@@ s. They're always there to fre@@ ak me out when I'm cle@@ an@@ ing.
No such person exist@@ s.
Do your b@@ est@@ !
I gave up hope.
She advised him to cut down on smoking.
No matter how much I think about it, I can't understand it.
She told him a joke.
Can you put the children to be@@ d?
Mari@@ e's hiding something from me.
Did you go to Tom's party last Satur@@ day?
He wrote a novel based on anci@@ ent my@@ ths.
Tom went rock cli@@ mb@@ ing.
She didn't like this game.
They've known each other for a very long time.
Don't touch th@@ is!
You've been warned.
He plays the piano very well.
What makes you so sure Tom was the one who sto@@ le your bicy@@ cle@@ ?
She has good ide@@ as.
What a horrible thing@@ !
We have no choice but to give up the whole plan.
You're a tr@@ ai@@ tor.
We take ris@@ ks all the time.
Z@@ ail@@ ai@@ b@@ a B@@ ar is h@@ ir@@ ing wai@@ ter@@ s@@ ; are you interested?
I can't lif@@ t my right ar@@ m.
I tried flying from the top of the tree.
This pri@@ est is a good man.
I sometimes lie on the grass.
Tom thought Mary was safe.
I just want to know why you brought me here.
Open the door.
It's almost hard to believe all these beautiful things were made by hand such a long time ago.
We assume that he is honest.
Are you all right?
Wh@@ ich@@ ever road you may tak@@ e, it will lead to the station.
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
He makes himself acc@@ es@@ sib@@ le to all who see@@ k his coun@@ sel@@ .
I'm sorry I mis@@ understood you.
Where can I find a tax@@ i@@ ?
She's going through a mi@@ d@@ life crisis.
The rescued refu@@ ge@@ es were long@@ ing for fre@@ ed@@ om.
Stop suc@@ king up to the teacher.
Re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly s@@ lam@@ ming the clu@@ t@@ ch ped@@ al, I some@@ how managed to get the clu@@ t@@ ch dis@@ engag@@ ed so I could just about drive for the time be@@ ing.
They did not believe me.
We know you're interested.
The house is bur@@ n@@ ing!
We consider Tom honest.
I'll give you a simple exam@@ ple.
W@@ in@@ ds from the sea are mo@@ ist.
We have arrived safe and s@@ ound.
We are going to leave tomorrow.
Mr W@@ il@@ son is proud of his house.
Are you sure you don't want one?
The meeting will be held re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the weather.
In the Ar@@ cti@@ c there are no pen@@ gu@@ ins.
She's young, nai@@ ve and in@@ experienc@@ ed.
